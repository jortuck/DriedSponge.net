## About
This is the server I use to host most of my personal projects. I originally started experimenting with self hosting a
few years ago as an effort to save money, and it just became a hobby of mine. My server was originally an old Windows 7
laptop which I installed Linux on because my parents no longer needed it, and it has since become it's own dedicated
machine running on old computer parts from my PC or hardware specifically purchased for it. Today I use it to host a
variety of services such as Minecraft servers, Teamcity, Pterodactyl, Shields, and many of my personal projects that
require more computing resources to run.
