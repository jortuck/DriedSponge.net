## About
I created this bot using Discord JS. My goal was to establish a way for my friends to easily create memes on the fly in
a Discord channel without having to go online to manually make them. I decided to use a combination of sharp and
node-canvas to achieve the ability to edit images. The bot supports JPEGs, PNGs, GIFs, and it even has the ability to
pull images directly from file URLs or Tenor!
