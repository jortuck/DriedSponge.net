## About

This website was created as a small side project to help assist the fundraising efforts for my high school jazz band at
the time. During my senior year of high school, our jazz band was selected as a finalist for the [Essentially Ellington
High School Jazz Band Competition](https://jazz.org/education/school-programs/essentially-ellington/){target="_blank"}.
In order to make the trip happen, we needed to raise a significant amount of funds.
We hosted a variety of fundraisers but one issues I noticed was there was no central place to identify where and when
everything was happening. Sometimes people would be directed to Facebook, to a QR code, or directly to the music
booster store. My goal with this simple project was to create one single website where everyone could see all the
events & fundraisers that were happening, without having to struggle with searching for this information. I have since
graduated from high school, but I still maintain the website in hopes that it will prove useful for band families.
