## About

This bot was created using [Discord JDA](https://github.com/discord-jda/JDA){target="_blank"} (Java Discord API). I was inspired to make it after Google started cracking down
on music bots that were using YouTube as an audio source. Because of this, my friends and I could no longer listen to
music together in a discord call. While this bot I created still uses YouTube as an audio source, I doubt Google will
send me a cease and desists letter because it's used personally, not commercially. If I do end up getting a letter from
Google though, I would be proud of myself for managing to get their attention. My goal is to make it easy to self host,
so people who need music in their Discord servers can have easy access to it.
